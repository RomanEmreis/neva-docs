# neva — MCP servers and clients in Rust

`neva` is a Rust SDK for the Model Context Protocol. One crate covers both
sides: `App` builds servers, `Client` builds clients, and a single process
can run both.

**This skill describes neva 0.7.x, which speaks MCP `2026-07-28` by
default.** That protocol generation broke compatibility with everything
before it. Most MCP knowledge in circulation — and every other MCP SDK —
describes the *older* generation, so the failure mode here is not "you
forget an API", it is "you confidently write the previous protocol". The
[Non-negotiables](#non-negotiables) section below is the list of places
where that happens. Read it before writing code, every time.

## Step 1 — establish the version and the profile

Do this first; it changes which API is correct.

```bash
cargo add neva --features server-full   # server
cargo add neva --features client-full   # client
cargo add neva --features full          # both
```

In an existing project, read `Cargo.toml`:

| What you find | What it means |
|---|---|
| `neva = "0.7"` and no `legacy-spec` | Default profile, MCP 2026-07-28. This skill applies as written |
| `neva = "0.6"` and no `legacy-spec` | Same protocol, but the client and `Context` calls are **flat** — `client.call_tool(..)`, `ctx.find_tool(..)` — where 0.7 has [namespaces](#the-namespaced-api). Write the flat ones on 0.6; no `svir` feature. `registry` and a retryable `Client::connect` need 0.6.1, not 0.6.0 |
| `neva = "0.5"` and no `legacy-spec` | As 0.6, minus synchronous handlers and per-request extensions; see [Handler shapes](#handler-shapes) for what 0.6 added |
| `features = [… "legacy-spec" …]` | **Legacy profile**, MCP 2024-11-05 … 2025-11-25. A *different* API. Read `references/legacy.md` before touching anything |
| `neva = "0.4"` or older | Pre-2026-07-28 by default. Read `references/legacy.md` for the upgrade |
| `proto-2026-07-28-rc` | A flag that no longer exists — remove it |

`legacy-spec` is a **switch, not an addition**: it compiles the 2026-07-28
surface out. The two generations never coexist in one build. Because Cargo
features are additive, `--all-features` turns `legacy-spec` **on** and
therefore tests the legacy profile — use `--features "server-full
client-full"` to exercise the default one.

## Step 2 — route to the reference you need

Load only what the task calls for; each file is self-contained.

| The task | Read |
|---|---|
| Tools, prompts, resources, schemas, content types, completion | `references/server.md` |
| Whether a handler should be `async fn`, a plain `fn`, or `blocking` | [Handler shapes](#handler-shapes), then `references/server.md` |
| DI, middleware, logging, progress, subscriptions on the server | `references/server.md` |
| Connecting, calling tools, batching, subscribing, client handlers | `references/client.md` |
| Asking the user for input mid-handler; `input_required`; re-run safety | `references/mrtr.md` |
| Long-running work, `tasks/get` polling | `references/mrtr.md` |
| Transport choice, TLS, JWT auth, DNS-rebinding, multi-instance deploy | `references/http.md` |
| OAuth 2.1 — protecting a server, authorizing a client, DPoP, CIMD, grants | `references/http.md` |
| Stopping a server from code; graceful shutdown; draining subscriptions | `references/http.md` |
| A custom HTTP stack (axum, hyper, actix-web) | `references/http.md` |
| Publishing a server: `server.json`, the MCP Registry, `mcp-publisher` | `references/http.md` |
| Giving a tool a UI; `ui://` resources; `_meta.ui`; MCP Apps | `references/apps.md` |
| Letting a model call MCP tools; an agent loop over a server's tools; answering sampling with a model (`svir` feature) | `references/svir.md` |
| An error code, a `-320xx` on the wire, or "why is this rejected" | `references/troubleshooting.md` |
| `legacy-spec`, MCP ≤ 2025-11-25, upgrading across releases (0.4 → 0.7) | `references/legacy.md` |

## A server that works

```rust
use neva::prelude::*;

#[tool(descr = "Greets a person by name")]
async fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {name}!")
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    App::new()
        .with_options(|opt| opt
            .with_stdio()
            .with_name("my-mcp-server")
            .with_version("1.0.0"))
        .run()
        .await;
}
```

`#[tool]` derives the name from the function, the JSON Schema 2020-12
`inputSchema` from the parameters, and the `outputSchema` from the return
type. Swap `.with_stdio()` for `.with_default_http()` to serve Streamable
HTTP on `127.0.0.1:3000/mcp` instead — nothing else changes.

## A client that works

```rust
use neva::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut client = Client::new()
        .with_options(|opt| opt.with_stdio("my-server-binary", ["--flag"]));

    client.connect().await?;

    for tool in client.tools().list_all().await? {
        println!("{}", tool.name);
    }

    let result = client.tools().call("greet", ("name", "World")).await?;
    println!("{:?}", result.content);

    client.disconnect().await
}
```

## The namespaced API

Since **0.7.0** the calls on `Client` and on a handler's `Context` are grouped
one namespace per MCP method prefix — `client.tools().call(..)` sends
`tools/call`:

| On | Namespaces |
|---|---|
| `Client` | `tools()` — `list`, `list_all`, `call`, `call_raw`, `as_task` · `resources()` — `list`, `list_all`, `templates`, `read` · `prompts()` — `list`, `list_all`, `get` · `tasks()` — `get`, `update`, `cancel` |
| `Context` | `tools()` — `list`, `find`, `find_many`, `call`, `call_all`, `add`, `remove` · `resources()` — `read`, `add`, `remove`, `notify_updated`, `is_subscribed` · `prompts()` — `list`, `get`, `add`, `remove` |

* **Write the namespaced form on 0.7.** The flat 0.6 spellings
  (`client.call_tool`, `client.read_resource`, `ctx.find_tool`,
  `ctx.resource_updated`, …) still compile but are `#[deprecated]`.
  `client.batch()` keeps its flat builder methods — they are current.
* **`ctx.tools()` is the namespace, not a listing.** `ctx.tools().await` does
  not compile on 0.7; it is `ctx.tools().list().await`.
* **Everything takes `&self`.** A handler takes `ctx: Context`, never
  `mut ctx` (it warns). A connected client is shared as `Arc<Client>`;
  only setup — `connect`, `map_*`, `on_*` — needs `&mut`.

## Handler shapes

Every registration point accepts a handler in one of two shapes, and the
shape is read off the signature. Pick by **what the body does with the
thread**, not by how short it is:

| The body | Write | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Awaits** — HTTP, an async driver, another peer through `Context` | `async fn` | On the runtime |
| **Computes** on data in hand — arithmetic, formatting, a map lookup | plain `fn` | Inline, no spawn, no yield |
| **Blocks** — `std::fs`, a sync DB or HTTP driver, `Command::output` | plain `fn` + `blocking` | Tokio's blocking pool |

```rust
use neva::{prelude::*, blocking};

#[tool(descr = "Greets a person")]
fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {name}!")
}

#[tool(descr = "Reads a text file", blocking)]
fn read_file(path: String) -> String {
    std::fs::read_to_string(path).unwrap_or_default()
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new()
        .with_options(|opt| opt.with_stdio());

    // The function form, for closures and non-macro registration.
    app.map_tool("read_other", blocking(|path: String| {
        std::fs::read_to_string(path).unwrap_or_default()
    }))
    .with_arg_names(["path"]);

    app.run().await;
}
```

Four things to get right:

* **Synchronous handlers are new in 0.6.0.** On 0.5.x every handler must
  return a future. If the crate in front of you is 0.5.x, write `async fn`.
* **`blocking` on an `async fn` is a compile error** — there is nothing to
  offload. It is also a pessimization on a short body: handing `a + b` to
  another thread costs more than the addition.
* **The published schema is identical either way.** Argument slots, the
  `inputSchema`, the `outputSchema` and the response do not depend on the
  shape, and `Result` works the same in both.
* **A `blocking` body is never cancelled** when the request is; it runs to
  completion and its result is discarded. A panic inside it propagates to the
  awaiting task, as it would inline.

Both shapes work on the client too: `Client::map_sampling`,
`Client::map_elicitation`, `#[sampling]` and `#[elicitation]`. Since 0.7.0 a
sampling handler may also return `Result<CreateMessageResult, Error>`.

The shape rides as a defaulted type-level marker (`neva::marker::Async` /
`marker::Immediate`) on the handler traits, inferred at the registration
site. It never appears in handler code. The one place it surfaces: a call
site that spells its generics out needs one more argument since 0.6 —
`map_tool::<_, _, (String,), _>(..)` — and fails with E0107 until it gets one.

## Non-negotiables

Each of these is a real difference between MCP 2026-07-28 and the
generation most training data describes. Getting one wrong produces code
that compiles and then fails on the wire.

1. **There is no `initialize` handshake.** A client opens with one
   `server/discover` request. `Client::connect()` does it; you never write
   an initialize/initialized exchange. Server side: nothing to implement,
   neva answers discovery from what you registered.

2. **The HTTP transport is stateless.** No `Mcp-Session-Id`, no session
   `DELETE`, no standalone SSE `GET` stream. Never write code that opens a
   `GET` stream to receive notifications — a client asks for them with
   `Client::listen(filter)` and they arrive on that request's own stream.

3. **`ping` is gone.** No `Client::ping`, no `BatchBuilder::ping`. A
   liveness probe is a `#[handler(command = "…")]` under your own method
   name.

4. **`logging/setLevel` is gone**, and with it `with_logging` and
   `set_log_level`. Logging is request-scoped: the client puts a level in
   the request's `_meta` and the notifications ride that request's response
   stream.

5. **Elicitation is a re-run, not a suspend.** `ctx.elicit(key, params)`
   takes a **replay key**, the handler unwinds, and the whole handler
   **runs again from the top** when the client answers. Everything above an
   elicit point executes on every round — wrap side effects in `ctx.memo`,
   `ctx.once` or `ctx.on_commit`. See `references/mrtr.md`. A handler
   written as if `elicit` merely awaits will double-charge cards.

6. **Sampling and roots are deprecated on arrival.** They still exist as
   MRTR input-request kinds, `#[deprecated]`, needing `#[allow(deprecated)]`
   at call sites. Do not build new features on them; do not delete them
   from code that has them.

7. **Tool arguments are extracted by name.** The handler's parameter names
   and the published `inputSchema` property names must match, or `App::run`
   refuses to start. `#[tool]` handles this. A **bare closure** passed to
   `map_tool` does not — Rust drops closure parameter names — so it
   publishes `arg0`, `arg1`, …; use the `map_tool!` macro or
   `.with_arg_names([...])`.

8. **Optional arguments are `Option<T>`**, not a hand-written schema
   without `required`. An `Option<T>` parameter is published as its inner
   type, left out of `required`, and arrives as `None` when omitted.

9. **Capabilities are declared per request, not once per connection.** They
   ride each request's `_meta` under
   `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities`, because there is no
   handshake to hold them. Ask `ctx.client_capabilities()` before requesting
   input; asking for a kind the caller did not declare ends the call with
   `MissingRequiredClientCapability` (`-32021`) rather than degrading.
   Extensions ride the same channel since **0.6.0** — `ctx.client_extension(id)`
   for any extension, `ctx.supports_apps()` for MCP Apps.

10. **A tool handler's `Err` is not a protocol error.** For `#[tool]`, any
    error becomes a *tool error* — a successful response with
    `is_error: true` that the model reads and can recover from. For
    `#[resource]` and `#[prompt]`, an `Err` is a JSON-RPC error and the
    request fails. Choose the handler kind accordingly.

## Verify before you claim it works

```bash
cargo check --features "server-full"     # or client-full / full
```

`cargo check` catches most of it, but two classes of mistake compile
cleanly and fail at runtime:

* an argument-name or schema disagreement — caught at **startup**, so
  actually run the binary once;
* a protocol-generation mistake — caught only by a peer.

Drive a real client against a server with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector cargo run
```

For HTTP, start the server and point the Inspector at
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp`.

## Conventions worth keeping

* `use neva::prelude::*;` is the intended import — it carries `App`,
  `Client`, `Context`, the macros, the types and the error model.
* A handler that needs the server takes `ctx: Context` and goes through its
  namespaces — `ctx.resources().read(uri)`, `ctx.tools().add(tool)`.
* A handler is an `async fn` or a plain `fn` — see [Handler shapes](#handler-shapes).
  Returning a plain `String`, `&str`, `Json<T>`, `Content` or
  `CallToolResponse` all work; prefer the simplest that fits.
* Registration order does not matter, and listings are sorted by name —
  the registries are `BTreeMap`-backed, which is what makes cursor
  pagination safe.
* Do not hand-write JSON-RPC envelopes, `_meta` keys or routing headers.
  neva builds them, and a hand-built one that disagrees with the body is
  rejected with `HeaderMismatch` (`-32020`).
